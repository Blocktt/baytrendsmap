# 1. Select Data

**Click** the **1. Select Data** page from the main menu located at the top of the webpage. The Select Data page provides two approaches to choose data for mapping. 

### 1a. Load final file

This option allows the user to select from a list of analyses prepared by Chesapeake Bay state stakeholders.  
  
+ **Select** the radio button corresponding to one of the options.  

+ Click **Load 'Final' File**.  

### 1b. Load user file

This option allows the user to upload a file created from  [baytrends](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=baytrends).  

+ Click **Browse** to select a user-created [baytrends](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=baytrends) output file.  

+ Select the file to upload and click **Open** from the file selection dialogue window.  

Before continuing, make sure the data file has loaded into the app. That is, wait for the blue progress bar to read Upload complete. A data table will also appear in the main window when the upload is complete. If the imported data are not in the proper format, then a “red” error message will appear in the main window instead of a data table.

# 2. Filtered Data

Click the **2. Filtered Data** button from the main menu located at the top of the webpage. This page will display filter options along the left-hand navigation panel. Use these filters to narrow the data to be displayed. 

This page displays four tabs below the main menu: 

+ Filtered Data Summary  
+ Filtered Data  
+ Range Map  
+ Change Map  

### Filtered Data Summary

The data table displayed in the main window summarizes the number of results per station. 

Notice the message “**yyy** = Number of entries with more than 1 record”. It is required to use the left-hand navigation filters to narrow the data until this message indicates “0” entries have more than 1 record. Most users will use the *Map Layer* filter to select which results to plot if one of the final files from the **1. Select Data** page was previously selected.

Also, notice the number of entries “Showing 1 to 5 of **zzz** entries” shown below the Station summary table. The **zzz** indicates the number of stations with data that could potentially be plotted in later steps. 

Click **Filter by State** (as well as CB Segment, Station Group, and Station Identifier) to set the filters for the geographic scope of the stations to be used in the analysis. The process of using the Select All and Deselect All radio buttons as well as making individual choices using the selection dialogue box is similar to other apps.

Click **Apply Filters** to apply the filters and update the data table in the main window.  

Click **Reset Filter Selections** and click the **Apply Filters** buttons to start over.

**User-created files:** The baytrends output files may have results for different parameters, models, layers (depths), periods (time periods), and seasons for each station. To make the app work, you need to filter the data down to 1 record per station in order to plot range or change maps. Use the Station summary table to guide the process of filtering data using the left-hand navigation panel, but also monitor the number of stations with data for plotting to ensure that you do not remove too many stations from the analysis.

### Filtered Data

This page displays the data to be mapped. The data in this table can be sorted.

### Range Map

Click the **Range Map** tab. 

**<u>Open and make a selection in each of the blue boxes under Range Map Options.</u>** An error may occur if selections are skipped. Then click Update Range Map.

Click the **Auto-generate Title** to generate a default figure title.

###  Change Map

Click the **Change Map** tab. 

**<u>Open and make a selection in each of the blue boxes under Change Map Options.</u>** An error may occur if selections are skipped. Then click Update Change Map.

Click the **Auto-generate Title** to generate a default figure title.
